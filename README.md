# 🩷 That Girl™ - An Ecommerce Store

I designed That Girl™ to be a women's catalogue where links to today's most trendiest products are easily accessible. Version 1.0 is my first prototype of the catalogue - there are many more additions to come! Stay tuned!

## 👩🏻‍💻 What I Am Working On:
- developing a script to scrape product descriptions from major retailor sites like Sephora, Aritzia, etc.
- adding a feature where if there are multiple colors for a product, there will be a seperate photo gallery for each color on the same page as the product
- implementing an automatic email system so user can get the links to the products right to their inbox
